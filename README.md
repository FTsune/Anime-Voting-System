# Anime Voting System

## Project Description

The Anime Voting System is a web application built using the Django framework. It allows users to vote for their favorite anime each season. The system also includes an admin panel with detailed statistics and charts to review voting stats based on different labels such as gender, age, and region. Admins can see anime rankings based on categories and seasons. The anime lists are updated manually every season (4 seasons per year), but users can only vote in the current season and view past season votes.
